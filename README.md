The purpose of this repository is to act as a bridge between the Threat Modeling and the security controls by providing an [equivalence table](#equivalence-table) between the [STRIDE](#stride-2) model and the [Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](#asvs-1) chapters.

## Rationale

In the Security Requirement Engineering process, we commonly use techniques like Threat Modeling (along with frameworks such as *STRIDE*, *LINDUNN* or *PASTA*) to identify threats to which the system is exposed. Once we have identified those threats, we need to mitigate them by defining security controls.

### Why do we need this table?

The third step of [Rapid Threat Modeling Prototyping (RTMP)](https://github.com/geoffrey-hill-tutamantic/rapid-threat-model-prototyping-docs/blob/master/18x26.Tutamen%20HOWTO-Rapid%20Threat%20Model%20Prototyping.pdf) methodology is *Mitigations*. The purpose is to define at least one mitigation for each STRIDE threat identified in the previous steps. In that section, it also provides a table that lists the elements of the OWASP Top 10 (OT10) mapped to STRIDE elements.

Detected improvements:
1. The OWASP Top 10 matrix is outdated (2017 version instead of 2021).
2. You need an extra step to select the security controls associated with those mitigations (from OT10 to ASVS).

To address the second issue, Mario Platt ([@mario-platt](https://github.com/mario-platt)) contributed to the repository by creating an Excel called [STRIDE-OT10-CWE-OPC-ASVS](https://github.com/geoffrey-hill-tutamantic/rapid-threat-model-prototyping-docs/blob/master/19h20.mar.mapping%20table%20-%20STRIDE-OT10-CWE-OPC-ASVS.xlsx), that not only maps STRIDE against ASVS but also with CWE, OWASP Proactive Controls and OWASP Top 10.

Detected improvements:
1. The OWASP Top 10 reference is outdated (2017 version instead of 2021).
2. The ASVS matrix is outdated (v3.0 instead of v4.0).

Finally, I have minor disagreements in some of the categorization of both references. In this repository, I will try to address the improvements mentioned above with [a new **STRIDE vs ASVS** equivalence table](#equivalence-table). 

## Pre-requisites

### Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) [^2]

The [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.

The primary aim of the project is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigour available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard. The standard provides a basis for testing application technical security controls, as well as any technical security controls in the environment, that are relied on to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This standard can be used to establish a level of confidence in the security of Web applications. The requirements were developed with the following objectives in mind:

* **Use as a metric** - Provide application developers and application owners with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in their Web applications,
* **Use as guidance** - Provide guidance to security control developers as to what to build into security controls in order to satisfy application security requirements, and
* **Use during procurement** - Provide a basis for specifying application security verification requirements in contracts.

### STRIDE [^3]

STRIDE is a model for identifying computer security threats developed by Praerit Garg and Loren Kohnfelder at Microsoft. It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories.
It was initially created as part of the process of threat modelling. It is used in conjunction with a model of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows, and trust boundaries.
Today it is often used by security experts to help answer the question *"what can go wrong in this system we're working on?"*. 

Each threat is a violation of a desirable property for a system [^4]:

| Threat                   | Emoji | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Desired property  |

## Equivalence table

The following table has an equivalence between ASVS chapters and STRIDE threats: [STRIDE-vs-ASVS-4.0.csv](STRIDE-vs-ASVS-4.0.csv)

### Table format

* **ASVS Chapter**: the chapter of the ASVS standard to be mapped.
    - Check ASVS high-level structure at [How To Reference ASVS Requirements](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/).
* **Teams**: the teams that are usually involved in the implementation of the control. 
    - Bear in mind that ASVS aims for an holistic approach to promote cross-team collaboration. "Security is everyone's responsibility!"
* **STRIDE**: threats applicable to that ASVS chapter (for more info check the [STRIDE](#stride) section).
    - There are some blank cells because some chapters that depend on the specific context of the project (i.e. *V12 - Files and Resources*) or are addressed in the design phase (i.e. *V1 - Architecture & Design*).
* **Notes**: additional context or comments if applicable.
* **References**: the short name of the reference:

| Short name | Reference | Author | Notes |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| RTMP | [**HOWTO-Rapid Threat Model Prototyping** book ](https://github.com/geoffrey-hill-tutamantic/rapid-threat-model-prototyping-docs/blob/master/18x26.Tutamen%20HOWTO-Rapid%20Threat%20Model%20Prototyping.pdf) | Geoffrey Hill, Tunamatic | Buit on OWASP Top 10 2017

| ASVS | [**Application Security Verification Standard v4.0.3**](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v4.0.3/4.0) | OWASP | N/A

## How to use

1. Understand the functional and technical requirements and their business context.
2. Use Threat Modeling with STRIDE to identify the threats.
    - My personal choice is [RTMP methodology](https://github.com/geoffrey-hill-tutamantic/rapid-threat-model-prototyping-docs), which is *agile-friendly*.
3. Use the [STRIDE vs ASVS table](#equivalence-table) to detect which ASVS chapter aims to mitigate each kind of threat.
4. Accommodate the requirements to the context of your problem (maybe some controls need modifications or not all of them are applicable).
5. Provide extra context using the [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) format.
    - Check [project ASVS User Stories](https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/project-ASVS-User-Stories) for practical examples.
6. Try to automate security controls as much as possible. Level 1 is usually easy to automate.
    - Check [OWASP ASVS 4.0 testing guide](https://github.com/BlazingWind/OWASP-ASVS-4.0-testing-guide) for practical examples.
7. Track the completion of the security requirements to handle [residual risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_risk).

## TODO

 - [ ] Find aditional references to support the categorization.
 - [ ] Decompose the ASVS chapters into sections to be more specific.
 - [ ] Create a [SecurityRAT](https://owasp.org/www-project-securityrat/) requirement set using this format.
